I'm thrilled to present my latest programming endeavorâ€”a Python-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. This project aims to provide a simple yet robust solution for encoding and decoding messages by allowing users to input a message and a shift value.

Here's a glimpse into how it works:

->User Interface: The program prompts users to choose between encryption and decryption. Once the choice is made, it asks for the key (shift value) to process the message.
->Encryption: When the user selects encryption, the program shifts each letter in the message by the specified key value, effectively scrambling the text to produce an encrypted version.
->Decryption: Conversely, selecting decryption shifts the letters back by the key value, restoring the original message from the encrypted text.

The program reads the input message from a file, processes it, and writes the encrypted or decrypted result to an output file. This ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience for handling textual data securely.
I'm excited about the potential applications of this project and looking forward to exploring more advanced cryptographic techniques in the future. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
