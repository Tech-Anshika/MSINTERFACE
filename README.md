-> Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. This project demonstrates a Python implementation that enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the letters by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.

-> Features
Encryption: Convert plain text into encrypted text using a shift value.
Decryption: Convert encrypted text back to plain text using the same shift value.
File Handling: Read input messages from a file and write the output to another file.

-> How It Works

- User Interface:

The user is prompted to choose between encryption and decryption.
The user inputs the key value (shift value).
The program processes the message based on the user's choice and key value.

- Encryption:

Shifts each letter in the message by the key value.
Handles wrap-around for letters at the end of the alphabet.

- Decryption:

Shifts each letter in the encrypted message back by the key value to restore the original text.
